                <p>Welcome to the first developer diary! I don’t know if I’ll have the mental fortitude to do these daily, but I want them to be 
                somewhat regular and frequent. The goal here is to be casual, free-flowing, and conversational. Sometimes we’ll deal with heavy 
                topics in the news, while others might just be what I ate for breakfast that day. Unlike other articles, these will probably never 
                be edited after they are published as I think that kind of defeats the point of a diary entry.</p>
                <h3>Status Check</h3>
                <p>I’m currently in Grand Rapids, Michigan meeting some online friends for the first time. It’s an entirely new experience and incredible 
                getting to meet people face-to-face rather than through a computer screen. Sushi and calamari are also delicious.</p>

                <h3>Today in America</h3>
                <p>According to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doj-officials-election-corrupt-donoghue-notes.amp">
                some notes</a> released by the Justice Department, Donald Trump asked DOJ officials to call the 2020 election “corrupt” in 
                an attempt to delegitimize the results. The notes were part of a House Oversight Committee investigation.</p>
                <p>The above link comes from a Fox News article, so you can’t really claim “liberal bias” on this one - although if you still believe 
                Trump won the 2020 election, you’re so far down the rabbit hole I don’t even know why you’re here. Still, I’d like to read the full 
                report and see what is sensationalized versus what isn’t.</p>
                <p>A particular line in the article that stands out to me is the one where Trump criticizes DOJ officials for “not following the Internet 
                the way I do”. When we talk about the actions of the Trump administration, as well as debate the authoritarian nature of Trump himself, 
                there’s a tendency to paint it as an evil mastermind leading the misinformed masses to the gallows. However, this quote confirms a 
                frightening realization I had later on in Trump’s presidency - the man is just that stupid. In reality, Trump consumed the same 
                conspiratorial blogspam his followers did. Tucker Carlson and Breitbart News may have had more influence over the President of the 
                United States than the President had over them. Just sit on that one for a bit.</p>
                <h3>Darknet Dorkery</h3>
                <p>One of my guilty pleasures is true crime. Since early college, I’ve loved following podcasts and YouTube channels about unsolved murders, 
                disappearances, and serial killers. Recently, I stumbled upon the enticing subworld of white-collar crime and cybercrime like darknet 
                markets. I might do some write-ups over the next few weeks on this topic, so stay tuned.</p>
                <h3>This Week in IPOs</h3>
                <p>The investing app Robinhood had a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-flirts-worst-debut-ever-172454124.html">
                particularly sour</a> IPO this week with causes pointing towards <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-stock-sale-soured-by-investor-confusion-valuation-concern-11627667523">
                investor confusion</a> and overall suspicion after the whole GME controversy. It leads one to question why the company would choose to IPO now as compared to later on down the line 
                when the issue is less fresh in people’s heads, or after an exonerating SEC investigation. Still, I’m not the CEO of a billion-dollar 
                company so I’m likely missing something.</p>
