                <h3>Status Check</h3>
                <p>My sleep schedule has been pretty screwed up (as sleep schedules tend to get during vacation), but last night I caught a lucky break 
                and fixed it after a night of drinking and festivities. I passed out around 1 or 2 am, woke up at 5, and have basically been up ever 
                since. I need to take more pictures of Michigan before I leave, but I’ve made
                an intentional effort to keep my phone in my pocket while I’m here. It turns out, the latest Twitter drama seems
                far less important when you’re at a bar with good friends and drinking daiquiris. Who knew? Maybe when I get back home I’ll institute a 
                weekly “low-tech” day where I leave the phone on the charger and experience the world how grandma and grandpa did.</p>
                <p>I’ve been doing research for a series on darknet markets, but there's some terminology that needs to get hammered out before
                that can proceed. That will probably get posted in the next day or so. I'm still figuring out how I should structure the articles,
                considering a lot of these places were busted a long time ago and have been scrubbed off the internet. Should the focus be on the markets themselves,
                or the efforts to bust them by law enforcement? What are some future trends in the arms race between the largest 
                investigative bodies in the world and illicit cybercriminals?</p>
                <h3>A Career Change?</h3>
                <p>I spent a few hours this morning researching careers in finance. Fintech startups are some of my favorite ones to 
                follow, and there was even a period in college where I tried to worm my way into venture capital. I 
                definitely want to max out my career in tech before I make any changes, but something in the realm of corporate 
                development or FP&A could be really interesting to make a run for. The best path would be a lateral shift into positions
                at tech companies like Twitter or Uber, or maybe even early-stage startups. Before that though, I'd probably try
                get into an MBA program at a target school. An MBA could be beneficial for going into high-finance, or even just 
                as a software engineer with aspirations for management.</p>
                <h3>Frustrations Over Drug Legalization</h3>
                <p>I don’t want to go into too much detail about this, as this blog is meant to be semi-professional, but marijuana legalization 
                needs to improve across the United States. Read into that as you will.</p>
                <h3>Learning Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Susan Rigetti (maiden name Fowler) recently published <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy">a guide</a> 
                to studying philosophy. As someone with an investment in politics and who fancies himself a thinker, I think it’d be interesting 
                to work through it and post my notes here. One of the first few books on the list is <span class="italic">Meditations</span>
                by Marcus Aurelius, which is already high up on my Goodreads bookshelf.</p>
                <h3>A New Headquarters</h3>
                <p>For the past year or so, I’ve been cultivating a list of cities in the United States I’d be interested in moving to. Kansas City is 
                where I grew up and definitely a nice place, but for the type of career growth I desire, it’s much too small. What makes things tough
                is that I refuse to move to San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, or London - coincidentally, the 
                largest cities in the world with the most economic and tech activity. Those housing prices are way too high for me to ever justify, 
                especially in a post-COVID world where remote work is becoming a possibility. That leaves a few candidates in the form of San 
                Antonio, Dallas, Chicago (a personal favorite), Atlanta, and Denver. If I really had to bite the bullet and deal with high housing 
                prices, I’d sooner go somewhere like Seattle, but that’s a big “if”. When it comes time to actually move, I’ll probably let the 
                company that hires me dictate the final decision, but thoughts and recommendations are always welcome.</p>
                <h3>Formula 1</h3>
                <p>Today’s F1 race was quite the spectacle to say the least. An early red flag in the session took out a lot of front-pack players, 
                leaving midfielders to take the advantage. This early shake up allowed Esteban Ocon and Sebastian Vettel to take a podium. In the 
                midst of a tense title fight between Verstappen and Hamilton, it’s nice to see a few new faces. The WDC is close with Max at 186 
                and Lewis at 192, as well as the WCC with Mercedes leading Red Bull by a mere 10 points.</p>
                <h3>Word of the Day</h3>
                <p>We’re gonna start a regular Word of the Day section. Why, you ask? Because I want to and it’s fun. Today’s word is urbane, meaning 
                notably polite or polished in manner.</p>
