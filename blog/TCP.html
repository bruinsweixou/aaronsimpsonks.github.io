                <h1>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h1>
                <p>July 18th, 2021</p>
                <p>Our modern world is interconnected. We speak through social media, send emails, watch Netflix, etc.
                We also speak in person through language, customs, and culture. All these things - emails, language, and
                the internet itself - rely on <em>protocols</em>. A <em>protocol</em> is system that two or more parties
                agree upon for purposes of communication and the transmission of information. By following a protocol,
                communication becomes almost transactional; so long as I provide you the required pieces of information
                i.e. satisfy my end of the protocol, you should be able to provide me something in return.</p>
                <p>Language itself is a form of protocol. For English speakers, we have an alphabet of characters and
                punctuation, as well as grammatical rules that we use to combine them in meaningful ways. So long as
                you and I both understand this alphabet and set of rules, we should be able to communicate with one another,
                rather than just screeching and making random noises.</p>
                <p>While devices connected to the internet don't speak English necessarily, they rely on the exact same
                principle to function. The same way that    the rules of English allow you to read the words on this page right now,
                protocols are what make Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Netflix, email, and other things all work seamlessly.
                In fact, if we're talking about the internet, one protocol in particular is important - the <em>Transmission
                Control Protocol</em> or <em>TCP</em>.</p>
