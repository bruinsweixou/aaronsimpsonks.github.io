                <h1>Learning Log #3</h1>
                <p>July 13th, 2021</p>
                <p>I completed my goal of working through the rest of Chapter 9 and am halfway through Chapter 10. I realized while
                reading that I'll need to start taking notes as I go, but that slows down my reading progress, which is already much
                slower than I'd like it to be. Tomorrow I'll make the decision to either take the hit and start taking notes, or just
                go back this weekend and write notes on the things I've read. The advantage of doing it immediately is that the concepts
                are fresh in my mind and I'll likely understand better. On the other hand, a weekend review can
                help cement the concepts in my mind by forcing me to go back over old material. I'll have to sleep on it and make a decision. 
                I could also use the resources in the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/software.html#PAPL%20chapter%209%20%26%2010%20Lists">
                workshop</a> page as a guide. I was going to try and make my notes into summarized, well-written blog posts, but I'll
                probably just transfer them to simple HTML, or even keep them in .txt form, and link them. Less work to do.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow, my goal is to read the workshop pages on Lecture 3 (which I've already listened to) and start on the
                    first assignment <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2018/docdiffdocdiff.html">DocDiff</a>.</p>
                <p>Finally, I'm considering organizing my learning logs per course/section of the overall curriculum. When I finish
                    this course, I might organize all of these learning logs into their own subpage so anyone coming after can easily
                    navigate.</p>
