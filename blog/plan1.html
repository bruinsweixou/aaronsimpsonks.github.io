                <h1>Teaching Myself CS</h1>
                <p>July 6th, 2021</p>
                <div>
                    <p>I'm teaching myself computer science...again...kind of.</p>
                    <p>Apart from work, I haven't done much programming since graduating college.
                    A part of me has hated myself for it, dying to pop open the text editor and start cracking away. The rest
                    reassures me that I've been through a lot and taking some time off is healthy. I can now 
                    confidently admit that the last two years of my degree burned me out in ways I'm still fully 
                    processing, so the latter half is probably on to something.</p>
                    <p>I never wanted to be <em>just</em> a software engineer; I wanted to be
                    <em>the best</em> software engineer I could possibly be. Even though I did well in my university courses
                    like Data Structures & Algorithms, I never quite grasped the material as well as I'd have liked
                    to. I think anyone who's been through college can attest that the optimization for a grade
                    sometimes comes at the cost of truly understanding the subject matter.</p>
                    <p>As an engineer, I naturally approach things from a first-order perspective - I like building strong foundations and
                    introducing new knowledge as circumstances necessitate, rather than having everything thrown at me all at
                    once or trying to work backwards from the top. For example, the best way to teach recursion in my opinion is to start with a problem
                    that requires it and introduce it as a solution, rather than starting with "teaching recursion" and backwards-rationalizing problems 
                    to further that end. I want to return to the roots and relearn computer science at a pace I'm comfortable with,
                    starting all the way back at the first "Hello, World" and going from there. As part of this goal, I'm sharing
                    some resources I found as a sort of "curriculum" to help guide my learning.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Teach Yourself Computer Science</h2>
                    <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Link</a>
                    <p>This resource seems to be exactly what I'm looking for - a place for self-taught engineers seeking
                    to broaden their foundations and learn skills like programming, data structures, compilers, and more. 
                    I'm familiar enough to know that this curriculum has a nice even mix of brevity and depth. 
                    Understanding everything here at even a base level would put me above and beyond what most engineers deal 
                    with in their day-to-day.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>A Self-Learning, Modern Computer Science Curriculum</h2>
                    <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">Link</a>
                    <p>This curriculum is <em>far</em> more comprehensive than anything else. I'm not confident that I'll make
                    it through all of it, or even that I'll necessarily want to, but I guess we'll see. Given enough time and dedication, I 
                    can see myself making it up to around Chapter 16. My only concern with this resouce is the potential for
                    link rot and having to find alternative sources in some places.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Books</h2>
                    <p>In addition to the above, here are some books I plan to read over the next year or so.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">
                            Clean Code</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>So yeah, all of the above should keep me occupied for a significant
                    period of time. It should also give me a fair amount of new blog material, so stay tuned.</p>
