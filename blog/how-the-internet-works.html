                <h1>The Internet</h1>
                <p>July 18th, 2021</p>
                <p>The internet is a global network of computing devices. The name "internet" is derived from "internetwork",
                    meaning a "network of networks" all connected to one another. As we analyze the structure of the internet,
                    we will come to understand why this term is fitting. As a platform for social media, communication,
                    and e-commerce, the internet has become an essential tool for the day-to-day functioning of the modern world.</p>
                <p>This blog post dives into some of the technologies that power the modern internet. It is by no means comprehensive,
                    and the different components of the internet, such as protocols and hardware, could each have an article of their own.
                    This post will simply give a broad overview by modeling the lifecycle of a basic message and the parties it
                    interacts with as it goes from sender(s) to receiver(s). We will also not be digging too much into the history of
                    the internet, except where absolutely necessary for contextual understanding.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it is important understand the distinction between the "internet" and the "World Wide Web". While most people 
                    use these terms interchangeably, they are not the same. The "World Wide Web" is a distributed system of documents all 
                    connected by links, also known as "hyperlinks". The internet is simply the underlying computing network that allows 
                    these documents to all be interconnected and transmitted around the world. In a sense, the Web can be thought of as
                    an "application" running atop the "machine" of the internet. Other examples of these sorts of applications include
                    services like email. This post simply deals with the machine and leaves the various applications for another day.</p>
