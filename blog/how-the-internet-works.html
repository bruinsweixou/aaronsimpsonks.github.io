                <h1>The Internet</h1>
                <p>July 18th, 2021</p>
                <p>The internet is a global network of computing devices. The name "internet" is derived from "internetwork",
                    meaning a "network of networks" all connected to one another. As we analyze the structure of the internet,
                    we'll come to understand why this term is fitting. As a platform for social media, communication,
                    and e-commerce, the internet has become an essential tool for the day-to-day functioning of the modern world.</p>
                <p>This blog post dives into some of the technologies that power the modern internet. It is by no means comprehensive,
                    and the different components of the internet, such as protocols and hardware, could each have an article of their own.
                    This post simply gives a broad overview by modeling the internet as the solution to the problem of a global
                    interconnected computer network. Also, we will not be digging too much into the history of the internet, except 
                    where absolutely necessary for contextual understanding.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, it is important to understand the distinction between the "internet" and the "World Wide Web". While most people 
                    use these terms interchangeably, they are not the same. The "World Wide Web" is a distributed system of documents 
                    connected by links, also known as "hyperlinks". The internet is simply the underlying computing network that allows 
                    these documents to all be interconnected and transmitted around the world. In a sense, the Web can be thought of as
                    an "application" running atop the "machine" of the internet. Other examples of these sorts of applications are
                    services like email. This post simply deals with the machine and leaves the various applications for another day.</p>
                <h2>A Simpler Problem</h2>
                <p>Like all things in computer science, we begin with a much simpler problem statement and organically expand outwards.
                The problem of building a worldwide computer network is much too large to consider on its face. Let's instead start with
                the simpler problem of connecting two computers together.</p>
                <p>In your mind, you can no doubt visualize the idea of two computers connected by a wire that transmits data back and forth.
                However, this model glosses over some of the fundamental aspects that make even such a simple solution possible:
                <ol>
                    <li>Identifiers - We need a way of identifying network members for the purpose of reference if we are to
                        have any hope of scaling. A simple way is by labeling one computer "Computer A" and the other "Computer B".</li>
                    <li>Channel/Medium - We need a way to actually get data from one computer to the other. For this model, the physical
                        wire serves this purpose. However, anyone who has used the modern internet knows there are more ways than this.</li>
                    <li>Protocol - In other words, we need a "common language" between network members so we can all understand each other.
                        A protocol specifies things like how data sent across the network should be formatted and what attributes it should
                        include. In this way, a message becomes almost transactional with one computer providing the agreed-upon information
                        from its half in exchange for the other half.
                    </li>
                </ol></p>
                <p>We'll go through each element one-by-one, explaining and expanding upon it.</p>
                <h2>Identifiers</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, as we scale our network from two nodes to eventually the entire globe, we'll need a way of
                identifying individual members. In our simple model, we identified them as "Computer A" and "Computer B". This system
                comes across a few limitations; for one, we're going to run out of letters eventually. Unless we want to start going to
                "Computer AA", "Computer BB", etc., we'll have to devise a new system with more breadth and possible identifiers; we
                want a larger <em>address space</em>. Furthermore, since we're ultimately dealing with computers, a numerical system
                might make more sense - one that can be more easily translated to binary without having to worry about character sets
                and other nonsense. Rather than words and letters, we can identify each member of the network with a unique number.
                We can instead call our members "1" and "2".</p>
                <p>However, this runs us into another problem. Because of the way computers represent numbers - 8-bit sequences called
                <em>bytes</em> - this system of just one number limits us to 256 maximum possible network members, which is nowhere near
                enough for the entire world. Instead, we could use a system more similar to the real internet with numbers like 128.156.
                18.1. Each of the 4 numbers between the dots in this scheme can be any value from 0 to 255. This comes with the advantage of a larger
                address space, as well as the ability to encode more information in an individual address, but we'll get to that later on. 
                For reasons we'll also discuss later on, addresses in this scheme are called <em>IP addresses</em>.</p>
                <p><em>Note:</em> Before any sysadmins or IETF members scream at me, yes I understand the limitations of IPv4 vs. IPv6,
                blah, blah. Listen, we're keeping it simple.</p>
