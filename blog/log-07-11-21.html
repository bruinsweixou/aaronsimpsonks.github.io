                <p>July 11th, 2021</p>
                <p>I've been working through the more comprehensive <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#org51acb29">
                    self-learning curriculum</a>. I've completed a few lectures in Section 2.1 and read some chapters of
                    the book. I'm still deciding how I want to progress, but I'm considering going through and watching
                    all of the lectures at 2.5x speed, then reading through the book and completing the practice assignments,
                    all while taking copious notes that I might format and share here. Today I listened to lectures 2
                    and 3 and read Chapter 8 on Processing Tables in the course book <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/tables-to-lists.html">
                    PAPL</a>.</p>
                <p>I might start listening to all the lectures tomorrow. My goal is to at least make it through lectures
                    4 and 5, then read Chapters 9 and 10 and start on the first assignment.</p>
                <p>So far, I've been enjoying this course. While it's an "introductory" computer science course, it covers a lot
                    of knowledge that I didn't know and have found interesting and useful. Lecture 3 in particular lends some
                    fascinating ideas on the amount of insight into your problem that simply understanding the structure of your
                    input data can give you.</p>
