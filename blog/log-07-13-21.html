                <h1>Learning Log #2</h1>
                <p>July 13th, 2021</p>
                <p>I've decided that the strategy of listening to every lecture, <em>then</em> reading is probably
                not the best idea. The creator of the curriculum I'm using has actually built a <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/software.html">
                notes</a> page to help. I'll be following along with the structure he provides as I think it forms a logical
                path for minimizing confusion and maximizing understanding.</p>
                <p>Due to this confusion, and some good old-fashioned procastination, I didn't quite hit the goals I set for yesterday.
                I completed Lecture 4 and most of Chapter 9. My goal tonight is to finish Chapter 9 and hopefully get at least
                halfway through Chapter 10. What I'd like to do is structure my sleep schedule so that I can wake up two hours
                before work, do two hours of studying, go to work, come home, then do an additional two hours. Weekends will
                provide even more time to push through it. I'm hoping to have this section of the overall curriculum completed by
                early to mid August at this pace.</p>
                <p>While this course is great, it hasn't exactly taught a ton of <em>practical</em> computer science knowledge
                for building projects. Because of that, I might start reading K&R C and start working on some project ideas I've
                had for additional resume fuel. I have an interest in graphics programming and there's a website called <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">
                Shadertoy</a> that lets you mess around and write shaders in the browser, so I might start playing around with that.</p>
