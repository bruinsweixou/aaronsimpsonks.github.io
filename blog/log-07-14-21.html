                <p>July 14th, 2021</p>
                <p>I'm realizing that working through the more comprehensive curriculum after a long day of work might not be
                the most optimal use of my time. This course might get relegated down to the weekend while I use the simpler,
                <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">less comprehensive</a> course for weekday work. The first part of this
                course involves reading SICP, which might be a bit easier on the brain, as well as faster to progress through
                and take notes on as I work.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow, my goal then is to start reading SICP. Expect tomorrow's log to have an attached .txt file with
                notes from the first bit of the book.
