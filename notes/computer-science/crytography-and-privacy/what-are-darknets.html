                <h2>What is a Darknet?</h2>
                <p>What is a darknet? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet">Wikipedia</a>, a darknet is an “overlay
                network within the Internet that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization, and often 
                uses a unique customized communication protocol."</p>
                <p>An overlay network is simply any network that runs atop - or is overlayed - on another network.</p>
                <img src="../../../image/Overlay.png" />
                <p>The most famous example of this is actually the Internet itself. In its early days, the easiest way to construct a 
                computing network was to take advantage of the existing telephone infrastructure, hence things like dial-up that killed 
                your connection if your mom wanted to call your aunt. An advantage of overlay networks is the abstraction of the underlying 
                network architecture, meaning that what is a multi-hop path in the underlying network can be treated as a single link 
                between two nodes in the overlaying network.</p>
                <p>Specific software could be tools like Tor or a peer-to-peer filesharing application like Napster. Authorization would 
                be things like password protection or cryptographic keys, ensuring that only specific trusted individuals could access 
                the network. Communication protocols specify how information being sent from one member of a network to another 
                should be formatted, as well as what information a valid message needs to include, such as an IP address to identify 
                the sender and destination, a payload, or a connection timeout date.</p>
                <p>Despite the name “darknet”, nothing about this concept is inherently malicious or implies illegality. There’s nothing 
                illegal about private networks, nor should there be. Indeed, despite the illegal activities they are best known for, 
                applications like Tor have been valuable tools for those living under authoritarian regimes.</p>
