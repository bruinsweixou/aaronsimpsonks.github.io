                <p>The following method of studying philosophy was originally outlined in Susan Rigetti's <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy"
                >So You Want to Study Philosophy...</a> guide. I'm copying it here for reasons of personal reference and signal-boosting, as I think this
                method is incredibly valuable for studying and understanding any new subject.</p>
                <p>The way it works is very simple - read everything four times:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once casual pass for general observation. The goal here is just to gain a simple map of the terrain.</li>
                    <li>Next pass is more focused. Take notes. Read to understand. Be able to determine what the author actually
                    means by what they're saying.</li>
                    <li>Third pass is for engagement and critique. Can you think of any arguments and examples, as well as counter-arguments
                    and counter-examples?</li>
                    <li>Fourth and last read is a cooldown read. Take notice of how you feel about and understand the text after deconstruction 
                    and engagement.</li>
                </ul>
