                <p>When you're learning something new, it can be helpful to think about why you're interested in learning that specific thing.
                If you're learning programming, are you doing it because you want to make video games? Maybe you want to work at Google, or even start 
                your own company. Having a solid foundation helps guide your learning towards what's relevant and what isn't. During
                particularly rough times, the answer to this question is also something you can come back to to keep yourself motivated.</p>
                <p>I'm a programmer by trade who plays video games, writes a blog, and watches Formula 1. I'm not formally-educated in philosophy, let alone 
                the next Plato or Aristotle, so why do I care? The answer is three-pronged.</p>
                <p>For one, I think any person by mere virtue of being human has something to gain by studying philosophy. Some of the deepest probing
                questions we ever ask ourselves are firmly within the dome of philosophy. What is the meaning of life? How do I be a good person? Whether 
                they've recognized it or not, most people have pondered some question related to philosophy. That's just how fundamental it 
                is to the human condition.</p>
                <p>Another reason I like philosophy is that it teaches you how to think and reason. I'm very politically-engaged and one of my biggest
                frustrations is the sheer lack of consistency or well-thought-out positions in most people's engagement with politics. People call out 
                behavior on one side while excusing the same behavior on their own. This is accompanied by endless grift and those unable to entertain 
                a conversation or debate beyond one or two levels of consideration. What I want is a system by which you can take factual statements 
                and moral principles and generate consistent answers. Being able to reason through an argument is how you counter the beliefs of your 
                ideological opponents, as well as convince others of your own.</p>
                <p>Finally, even as a programmer, ethics and philosophy are directly applicable to my field of work. The dialogue companies like Facebook
                and Google have opened about the importance of user privacy and the influence of social media on society is direct evidence of that. 
                Without ethics, we cannot hope to build technologies that improve people's lives. In fact, we may actually succeed in doing the opposite.</p>
                <p>That is why I study philosophy - because it's too important not to.</p>
