                <p>My screwed-up sleep schedule means two diaries falling on August 2nd. The first one was written mostly on August 1st, but 
                due to vacation and being out and about, I didn’t get it published until around midnight. Things will get more regular 
                when I get back home, I promise. For now, despite the timestamp saying August 2nd, I've gone ahead and named it for August 1st.</p>
                <h3>Status Check</h3>
                <p>My vacation ends on Wednesday. I'm not the happiest camper around, but you can't lounge around forever. I think a nice
                break is what I needed. I've learned a lot about myself through deep conversations with the friends I've been staying with.
                They've given me a lot of feedback about the way I live my life and how it could be different.</p>
                <p>Discussions have been had about meeting up in Chicago next March for St. Patrick's Day.
                Considering Chicago is high up on my list of cities to move to, it would be nice to take a trip and see if it's all
                it's cracked up to be. If so, I'll probably announce it before I go.</p>
                <h3>Climate Anxiety, Simple Living, and Happiness</h3>
                <img src="./August 2nd, 2021_files/Pollution.jpeg">
                <p>These were going to be three separate sections, but they’re all interconnected enough to warrant one big section that links them all.</p>
                <p>I try not to follow climate science too much, as it tends to dramatically increase my anxiety and fear for the future. I’m content 
                acknowledging the reality, trying to live a more sustainable life, and advocating for politicians that will push beneficial policies 
                like carbon taxes and renewable energy. However, sometimes it’s just too hard to ignore and some of it popped up in my Twitter feed 
                last night. Noah Smith <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1422078087529787395?s=20">retweeted</a> a thread discussing the 
                effects of 3 degrees Celsius of warming and why it’s essential to prevent it. The typical waves of anxiety came along, but also questions 
                about how to manage it and what my personal options are. In a world where climate change is likely going to be a reality, how can I survive?</p>
                <p>The first thought that popped into my head is the idea of “environment-independent happiness”. For most people, our environment plays 
                a significant role in our moods like happiness. Some of this is attached to basic things like food, water, and shelter, but a lot of 
                it also comes from things like people’s validation of us.</p> 
                <p>While some of this is unavoidable, it’s possible to have too much of your happiness invested in these external sources. Since you’re 
                not omnipotent, you are trusting your happiness to be bent and shaped by forces that you can’t control, which I personally don’t like. 
                If your mind is a book, high investment of this kind is giving others a pen and letting them write the pages. No bueno.</p>
                <p>It’s important to have a certain fragment of your happiness independent and self-generated from within. This is hard to do and you have 
                to sort of fake it at first, but it’s absolutely possible. In this way, you can insulate yourself from the turbulence and change of 
                the outside world. Even if I was to lose my job tomorrow, or get evicted, or lose a family member, I’d still have a baseline level of 
                contentment and energy to keep me going. Mindset absolutely plays a role, and I think whether or not I’m happy in a climate-changed 
                world 20 or 30 years from now is a choice I can make.</p>
                <p>Alongside a shift in mindset can also come physical preparations. I’m not gonna go full shotgun shells and frozen food, but I think 
                a degree of simple living is worth exploring. I’m already an incredibly minimalist person, so it’s in my nature to a degree. Things 
                here would align closely with the traditional “sustainable” lifestyle - smaller apartment, walk or bike as much as possible, shift 
                diet, learn to grow food and cook, unplugged days, etc.</p>
                <p>Like all living creatures, human beings can adapt. In fact, humans are uniquely capable of adaptation due to our intelligence and 
                self-awareness. Climate anxiety doesn’t have to mean eternal depression. Take joy in everything that you can and push for those 
                making real change, but also prepare.</p>
                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>I want to try photography. Last night, I was reminded of the photo Migrant Mother by Dorothea Lange.
                You may not recognize the name, but you’ve absolutely seen it before:</p>
                <img src="./August 2nd, 2021_files/MigrantMother.jpeg">
                <p>The composition and storytelling of this photo is what made it a cultural icon of the Great Depression. I might also just have a 
                thing for monochromatic images. I took a photography class in high school, but it didn’t go well for a wide variety of reasons. 
                It was also traditional darkroom photography, which added its own unique set of challenges. I’d like to try it again, starting 
                with some simple iPhone photos and going from there. I’ll make a separate gallery page for my photos and start uploading them 
                there when I start. Stay tuned.</p>
                <h3>A World Without Privacy</h3>
                <p>This is going to be written into a separate article eventually, but over the course of debating with my friends last night, 
                one of them voiced the opinion that they didn’t think privacy was a fundamental right. Needless to say, this caused quite the 
                stir. The notion of a world without privacy sounds completely unsustainable, but I can’t quite yet articulate why. All I 
                know is, I can write about it for a long time.</p> 
                <p>A particular argument brought up was that we don’t live in a private world right now with corporations like Facebook and Google. 
                While that is true to some extent, until the government starts mandating that we poop with the door open, I think there’s still 
                a fight for privacy to be had.</p>
                <p>Another one was the common refrain of “if you have nothing to hide, you don’t need privacy.” I’d hope by now everyone recognizes 
                why this is absurd - again, pooping with the door open. It also eventually verged into the topic of data leaks and encryption 
                backdoors for law enforcement.</p>
                <p>Many words to be written. Many thoughts to be had.</p> 
                <h3>What I’m Reading</h3>
                <p>As mentioned in my previous diary entry, I’m going to be starting Meditations by Marcus Aurelius as an introduction to 
                philosophy. What better starting point than the thoughts of a Roman emperor?</p>
                <h3>Word of the Day</h3>
                <p>Today’s word is <i>hagiography</i>, meaning a biography of saints or venerated persons.</p>
